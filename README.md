Make sure you have Python installed, then run:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
'
3. Set Up Twilio API:
Sign up on Twilio and get your SID, Auth Token, and WhatsApp number.
Create a .env file in the root directory and add your Twilio credentials:
```env
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_sid_here
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token_here
TWILIO_WHATSAPP_NUMBER=your_twilio_whatsapp_number

```

Frontend Setup (React):
This section covers setting up the frontend of the AI-powered WhatsApp chatbot, where users can interact with the bot.
'
1. Clone the Frontend Repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/whatsapp-chatbot-frontend.git
cd whatsapp-chatbot-frontend
```
'
2. Install Frontend Dependencies:
Run the following command to install necessary packages:
```sh
npm install
```
'
3. Set Up Proxy for API Requests:
To avoid issues with CORS in development, set up a proxy in the src/setupProxy.js file for API requests to the Flask backend:
```js
const { createProxyMiddleware } = require('http-proxy-middleware');
'
module.exports = function (app) {
  app.use(
    '/webhook',
    createProxyMiddleware({
      target: 'http://localhost:5000',
      changeOrigin: true,
    })
  );
};
```
'
4. Start the Frontend Application:
After installation, run the React app:
```sh
npm start
```
The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000.
'
How It Works:
Users send messages to the WhatsApp bot.
If a keyword matches, the bot replies with a predefined response.
If no keyword matches, it uses AI (GPT) to generate responses.
The bot supports both Bangla & English messages automatically.
